          <h2>How I Started Coding</h2>
          <p>
            My journey into the world of programming began in high school when I took my first computer science class. I was fascinated by the logic and creativity involved in writing code. This passion led me to pursue a degree in computer science, where I learned various programming languages and developed my problem-solving skills. Over the years, I've worked on numerous projects, each one teaching me something new and helping me grow as a developer.

          <h2>Top 5 Tips for New Developers</h2>
          <p>Getting started in web development can be both exciting and challenging. Here are my top five tips for new developers:</p>
                <ol>
                    <p><strong>Master the Basics:</strong> Make sure you have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before diving into more advanced topics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build Projects:</strong> Apply what you've learned by building small projects. This will help you understand how different concepts work together.</p>
                    <p><strong>Learn to Debug:</strong> Debugging is an essential skill. Use tools like Chrome DevTools to find and fix issues in your code.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stay Updated:</strong> Web development is constantly evolving. Follow blogs, subscribe to newsletters, and join communities to keep up with the latest trends and technologies.</p>                   
                     <p><strong>Practice, Practice, Practice:</strong> The more you code, the better you'll get. Set aside time every day to write code, even if it's just for a short period.</p>
